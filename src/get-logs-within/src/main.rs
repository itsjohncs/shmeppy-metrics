/**
 * This program is designed to churn through all of the log files Shmeppy
 * has ever made on-demand and produce only the logs that fall within a
 * particular range.
 *
 * It needs to run very quickly, as it's used by `build-convocations-aggregate`
 * to grab all the logs in a three-day span, for every day since Shmeppy's
 * inception. Fortunately `build-convocations-aggregate` does some smart
 * caching across runs so it doesn't actually repeat itself more than
 * necessary, but this is still going to be run quite often.
 *
 * Currently it trails `wc -l` by just a little bit. Because of the filesystem
 * caching that's bound to happen, memory maps should speed this up. But I
 * think if this starts getting slow a simple short-circuit will help: peek
 * the beginning and end of each file to get the range of days in each file
 * (give or take a day) and skip it if it's out of range.
