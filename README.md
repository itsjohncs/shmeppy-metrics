# Shmeppy Metrics

I use the code in this repo to understand how people are using [Shmeppy](https://shmeppy.com).

## Why No License?

This is not open source code, but rather "source available." Only I have access to Shmeppy's logs and its database (hopefully), so this code is unlikely to be useful to anyone else. It's available as a curiousity for Shmeppy users, nothing more.
